# To-Do App

This is a To-Do app made with React. I made this project to practice my React skills.


## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/srai98i/to-do.git
  cd to-do-app
```
## Deployment

https://reactodo-sim.netlify.app/


## Functionality

- User can type in a task and save it to a list
- User can tick checkbox when specific task is completed
- User can delete specific task from list
- User can delete entire list 

Coming Soon:

- A database to store To-Do's so user's data can persist between refreshes
- Authentication & User Profiles so To-Do's are unique to each user

## Challenges & How They Were Solved

### File Structure
- Having learned React for only two weeks, I was unfamiliar with how to structure my files. My first attempt to structure components was confusing and made building this app more complicated than it should have been. I was able to fix this by using my component tree and thinking about how each component interacted with each other more carefully to make a more understandable file structure.

### CSS 
- My initial CSS knowledge was not strong before starting this project, which made sizing and positioning very difficult. This project has been helpful in developing my CSS knowledge as I have had to learn more about flexbox properties. I have experimented with flexbox and grid styling and feel more confident with styling and positioning.

### Authentication and User Profiles
- An upcoming challenge will be to implement User Profiles so To-Do's are specific for each user.
